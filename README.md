# Hoshdarino

![Project Logo](assets/logo.png) <!-- Add logo when available -->

Hoshdarino is an intelligent software system that provides real-time information about natural disasters. The system helps users stay informed about potential hazards by displaying a map of the country and identifying high-risk areas, enabling them to take necessary precautions. The platform also sends urgent alerts to users during critical situations.

## 🌟 Features

### Interactive Map
- National map display with zoom and navigation capabilities
- Highlighted disaster-affected areas and high-risk zones
- Real-time updates on disaster locations

### Natural Disaster Coverage
- **Earthquakes**: Tectonic movements and high-risk zones
- **Floods**: Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, and flood-prone areas
- **Fires**: Wildfires and urban fires
- **River Overflows**: Rising river levels and flood predictions
- **Storms and Tornadoes**: Severe weather alerts and forecasts
- **Snow and Frost**: Heavy snowfall and freezing conditions

### Alert System
- User subscription for immediate alerts
- SMS and notification system for dangerous areas
- Customizable alert preferences based on disaster type

### Data Analysis
- Real-time disaster data updates
- Historical data analysis and pattern recognition
- Statistical visualization tools

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Provide real-time information about various natural disasters
- Raise public awareness about natural hazards
- Create a fast alerting platform for people at risk
- Use analytical data to identify disaster occurrence patterns

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database
- MongoDB for storing disaster-related data
- Structured data schema for disaster history
- API integration with reliable data sources

### User Interface
- Interactive map interface using Google Maps API/OpenStreetMap
- Color-coded risk zones and warnings
- Detailed area information and search functionality

### Alert System
- User registration and alert preferences
- Location-based alert triggers
- Multi-channel notification system

### Data Analysis
- Machine learning algorithms for disaster prediction
- Historical data analysis
- Statistical visualization tools
